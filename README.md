This repository contains machine learning methods for supervised learning and unsupervised learning of A-domain data.
Supervised Learning depends on a file 'Adomain_Substrate.fa.hmmpfam2' that is the result of applying AntiSMASH to data from Chevret et al.
AntiSMASH itself has several dependencies which can be found at https://docs.antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/install/#dependencies-via-bioconda
